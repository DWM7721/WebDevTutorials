## What I got out of it:

 - started using aria labels (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) to specify information about elements on the page to make them more accessible.
 - learning new emmet shortcuts (element.name will generate a new element with name as the class)

### SVG's
#### Rect tag
- The y value of the rect tag is related to the top left corner of the rectangle; a y value of 100 in a viewbox of 0 0 100 100 will cause the rectangle to go offscreen. therefore the usable space is actually 0-90 (100-height of rect) and so the middle is 45
- rx for border radius, make it half of the x value to get a perfect curve
